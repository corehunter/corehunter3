## What is Core Hunter?
Core Hunter is a flexible tool to sample diverse, representative subsets from large germplasm collections, with minimum redundancy. Such so-called core collections have applications in plant breeding and genetic resource management in general. Core Hunter can construct cores based on genetic marker data, phenotypic traits or precomputed distance matrices, optimizing one of many provided evaluation measures depending on the precise purpose of the core (e.g. high diversity, representativeness, or allelic richness). In addition, multiple measures can be simultaneously optimized as part of a weighted index to bring the different perspectives closer together.

Version 3 has been recoded from scratch using the [JAMES framework](http://www.jamesframework.org) which provides the applied optimization algorithms.

## Getting started with Core Hunter
Core Hunter is available in 3 flavours.

* For most users we recommend the [desktop version](desktop). 
* For users looking to include CoreHunter in analytical pipelines we recommend the [R version](r). 

Core Hunter is implemented in Java. In both cases you will need to have installed a [Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) version 8 or later.
